# SCREAMSCRIPT

_The language of your screams_

<hr>

SCREAMSCRIPT is a dynamic programming language heavily influenced by the Lox programming language.  One might even say I
took my implementation from the [Tree-Walk Interpreter](http://craftinginterpreters.com/a-tree-walk-interpreter.html) 
component of [Crafting Interpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com), then just edited the source so that keywords,
identifiers, etc. could only be ~CAPTIAL~ SCREAM CASED, because that's exactly what I did.
